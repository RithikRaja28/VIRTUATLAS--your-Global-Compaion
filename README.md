# Virtuatlas - Your Global Companion, Your own Language

*This is just the front-end created and further updates will be committed*

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Problem Statement

🚗 Urban public transportation applications, especially in diverse 🌐 linguistic regions like 
India, often struggle with delivering accessible and efficient mobility solutions. The challenge is 
magnified by the need for real-time responsiveness and language inclusivity in fast-growing 
urban areas 🏙️. Develop solutions using RAG systems and real-time data to enhance urban public 
mobility. These solutions should not only address traffic and public transport efficiency but also 
provide multilingual support, making use of 🌍 Indic local models or efficient prompting within 
existing foundational models for language translation.

## Proposed Solution

Virtuatlas focusses on 📅 real-time Analytics and Generative systems for multilingual urban transportation 🚋 solutions with support of indic languages. It focusses on three main categories, the common men, emergency vehicles like police, ambulance, water services and the logistics group. The various features like the multilingual traffic management systems, Public Trasnport scheduling , environmental impact awareness along with 📲 hubs being established elsewhere will help in supporting the people achieving the sustainable goals for the nation and travelling made stress free and safe.

● Multilingual Traffic Management Systems: Utilize RAG for real-time traffic updates and advisories in multiple languages.

● Dynamic and Inclusive Public Transport Scheduling:   
    Enhance public transport systems with real-time, multilingual information dissemination.
    
● Cross-Lingual Environmental Impact Awareness Solutions to inform diverse populations about urban transport's environmental impacts in their local languages.

### Personalised Recommendations:

●  App gives user categorized login, system and routes by
means of prioritizing the emergency.Deployed at bus
stands and metro stations, almost all over the place the
hardware hub serves as an interactive point

### Mobile App Integration:

●  The App contains features like 🌐 multimodal integration which also
serves for disabled peoples with their preferred languages and
contains real-time data of environmental impacts (Real time
updates) and Google Map Integration and also contain offline
language packages

### Beneficial:

●   Real-time Analytics and Generative Systems Integration.
●  Multilingual Support with a Focus on Indic Languages. 
●  Specialization for users.
●  Sustainability and Environmental Impact.
●  The Sustainable development goals (3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,17) areachieved with the help of Virtuatlas
